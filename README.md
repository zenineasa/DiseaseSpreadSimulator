# DiseaseSpreadSimulator
You can tweak the parameters and observe how population size, number of infected people, probability of dying and duration to get cured affect the macroscopic statistics of a pandemic.

For more information, have a look at the following blogpost.

I understand that the code is not very well written and has scope for improvement. If anyone is interested in improving it further, please do let me know.
